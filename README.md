# introduction
Hey! In this README I will be explaining all about Jasper Lang! 
This is a custom-made coding language based off of Python, C++ and similar style to low-end code like Assembly Code. 
Official releases will be expected within the next year! All code and compiler will be open-source.
Future projects using Jasper Script are planned and will be in action when Jasper Script it released.

Thanks for reading and we hope you're just as excited as we are with this project!

(We aren't responsible for any damage using Jasper Script.)
